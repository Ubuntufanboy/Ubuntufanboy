# Sup, I'm Apollo

## A little bit about me  
I'm a high school student passionate about Artificial Intelligence, robotics, and low level code. I've been working on AI research for several years, researching biological implementations of neural networks.  

- Researching **Biochemical Processing Units (BPU)** and **"Translation Layer prompting"**  
- Developing optimizations for LLM interfaces and smarter Neural Network implementations. 
- Building robots for the **RoboCup Junior Open**  
- Learning more about low level code and cybersecurity.

## Open-Source-Week
Here are some of my projects I released for Open Source Week!:  

- Day 1: **[Tales Of Zenmania](https://github.com/Ubuntufanboy/tales-of-zenmania)** – A small fun game inspired by "1984" by George Orwell
- Day 2: **[Robot Strategy Playground](https://github.com/Ubuntufanboy/robot-simulation)** – A way to place 2 robots against eachother in a match of 2v2 soccer!
- Day 3: **[DJ-CHIP](https://github.com/Ubuntufanboy/DJ-CHIP)** – A customizable way to create true 8-bit music with raw sound waves!
- Day 4: **[Zenith Interpreter](https://github.com/Ubuntufanboy/Zenith)** - A BASIC inspired interpreter that runs entirely in the context window of an LLM.
- Day 5: **[Helios](https://github.com/Ubuntufanboy/Helios)** - My flagship Open Source Week submission. An entire game console with custom Video/Audio and Custom 8 bit CPU. Check it out!

Here are the repositories released by my good friend [Zen](https://github.com/zen-ham) for Open Source Week as well:

- Day 1: **[zhmiscellany](https://github.com/zen-ham/zhmiscellany)** - An organized collection of unique and useful functions/classes/modules/bindings.
- Day 2: **[garrysmod workshop scripts](https://github.com/zen-ham/garrysmod_workshop_scripts)** - Scripts for interacting with the steam workshop and building files related to the steam workshop
- Day 3: **[Tales of Zenmania 2](https://github.com/zen-ham/tales_of_zenmania_2)** - Far expanded version of my original game "Tales of Zenmania".
- Day 4: **[Local LLM Agent](https://github.com/zen-ham/local_llm_agent)** - An LLM agent implementation in python.
- Day 5: **[Search OCR](https://github.com/zen-ham/Search-OCR)** - Local OCR indexer and search engine, digests all image files on the system into a pickle cluster and allows key word or sentence searching in real time across 100K+ files.
