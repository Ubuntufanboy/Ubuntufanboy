## About me

I am just a dude who likes making things from the ground up. I love to over engineer things. Python is my life. I see in python, Hear in python, smell like python ðŸ˜³! Feel like python ðŸ¥µ... Taste like python ðŸ˜›.

I try to use vim but it can be quite difficult so I end up using vsc as a guilty pleasure. I am a student who studies computer science. Massive nerd. I love to write usless pieces of software because code is fun for me. 

YAGNI is a smart mentality but as long as I am having fun don't spoil it for me. 

## Skills 

Python (8 months experience)
Linux(8 years of experience)

I know the ropes with linux

# Thank you for your time
